# Vertical-Displacement-Plots
ðŸŒŸ This repository contains various python scripts and notebooks that can be used to demonstrate the effect of static and dynamic loads in high rise buildings. Calculated gravity load deformations in buildings can vary depending upon the analysis technique used (e.g with or without construction stage analysis). Accurate modeling of vertical displacements can be critical in tall buildings.

ðŸŒŸ These effects are can be effectively studied with column vertical displacement plots generated with matplotlib. The building elevation on y axis vs vertical deformations on x axis like in the image below: <br>


# Requirements
- ðŸŒŸ Structural analysis results from any software like ETABS, Tekla Structural Designer, Autodesk Robot...
These results could be in form of excel tables which could be further manipulated with python pandas, a few API python functions for extracting such results from ETABS have been developed as alternatives.

- ðŸŒŸ Matplotlib library for making graph/data visualizations. Check out more about this python package at https://matplotlib.org/
- ðŸŒŸ Pandas library for dealing with tabular data (OPTIONAL). See more here https://pandas.pydata.org/ (OPTIONAL)
- ðŸŒŸ Numpy library for faster capability when dealing with large data. See more here: https://numpy.org/ (OPTIONAL)
- ðŸŒŸ Jupyter Notebook for easier workflows. See more here https://jupyter.org/ (OPTIONAL)

# Workflow
The workflow for making these plots is pretty much basic. The end goal is to plot story elevations in y-axis against Vertical Deformation of Structural elements (columns) in x-axis. 

Story elevations can be extracted by; 
- using ETABS API python functions in this repo, 
- excel tables generated by any Structural Analysis Software
- inputed manually as python lists.

Vertical Displacements (UZ) (columns, walls... whatever vertical element in study) can be extracted by
- using a ETABS API python functions in this repo, 
- excel tables which can be manipulated with pandas,
- calculated manually and inputed into python lists, numpy array, pandas series/ dataframes

The elastic strain or vertical displacement can be calculated with Hooke's Law as: <br>
$\epsilon = {\phi \over E}$

where:
$\phi$ is the stress calculated as $F \over A$
$E$  is the young's modulus


A simplified template workflow in form of jupyter notebooks is included in this repo. Although the steps are general, variables, methods and functions can be modified to suit user needs.
